Load data

================================================================================

6.) Choose date to load, and number of days:

	timespan,'2021-04-16',3

7.) type:

spp_swp_spi_load 

This loads the protons (the sf00 data product). Each variable will have a number. For example, the variable 'psp_swp_spi_sf00_L3_DENS' might have the number '2' next to it. To plot it, type:

	tplot,2 

Plot multiple variables using brackets:

	tplot,[2,8]

You don't have to put numbers, you put the variable name in quotes:

	tplot,'psp_swp_spi_sf00_L3_TEMP'

8.) To load electron data, type:

	spp_swp_spe_load

For encounters 1-9, the strahl electrons are the variable:
'psp_swp_spe_sf0_L3_EFLUX_VS_PA_E8'

9.) Now ad this variable to the top of the plot (using either the number or name)

	tplot,/ad,'psp_swp_spe_sf0_L3_EFLUX_VS_PA_E8'

10.) If you want to pick the order of panels, type:

	tplot,/pick
Then use your cursor to click.

11.) If you want to resize the window, drag from the bottom right corner. Then type

	tplot 

Again to re-plot on the larger window.

12.) To zoom in on a time, type:

	tlimit 

And use your cursor to select the time range.

13.) To go back to the last time range you were looking at, type:

	tlimit,/last 

And for the full time range of data,
	
	tlimit,/full
